### **✅ Solution: Mention the User in the Bot's Response**
To mention the user who requested a command, use **`ctx.author.mention`** in the bot's reply.

---

### **🔹 Example: Updating Commands to Mention the User**
Modify your bot’s response to include `ctx.author.mention`, so the bot will tag the user who sent the command.

---

#### **✅ Example 1: Mention User in `!set_alert`**
```python
@bot.command(name='set_alert', help='Set a price alert. Restricted to Trusted users.')
async def set_alert(ctx, asset: str, price: float):
    if not is_authorized(ctx):
        await ctx.send(f"🚫 {ctx.author.mention}, you need the 'Trusted' role to set alerts.")
        return
    try:
        with open(ALERTS_FILE, "a") as f:
            f.write(f"{asset.upper()},{price},{ctx.author.id}\n")
        await ctx.send(f"🔔 {ctx.author.mention}, alert set for {asset.upper()} at **${price}**.")
        logger.info(f"Alert set for {asset.upper()} at ${price}")
    except Exception as e:
        await ctx.send(f"⚠️ {ctx.author.mention}, error setting alert for {asset}: {e}")
        logger.error(f"Error setting alert for {asset}: {e}")
```

---

#### **✅ Example 2: Mention User in `!crypto`**
```python
@bot.command(name='crypto', help='Get cryptocurrency price. Usage: !crypto COIN')
async def crypto(ctx, coin: str):
    try:
        price = get_crypto_price(coin)
        await ctx.send(f"💎 {ctx.author.mention}, the current price of **{coin.capitalize()}** is **${price} USD**.")
        logger.info(f"Crypto price retrieved for {coin}")
    except Exception as e:
        await ctx.send(f"⚠️ {ctx.author.mention}, error fetching crypto data for {coin}: {e}")
        logger.error(f"Error fetching crypto data for {coin}: {e}")
```

---

### **✅ How This Works**
- `ctx.author.mention` **tags the user** who sent the command.
- The bot **directly responds to the user** instead of sending a generic message.
- Works for **all commands** (`!stock`, `!portfolio`, `!news`, etc.).

---

### **🚀 Next Steps**
1. **Update your commands** to include `ctx.author.mention`.
2. **Restart your bot**:
   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```
3. **Test by sending a command in Discord**:
   ```bash
   !crypto bitcoin
   ```
4. **The bot should now mention you in its response**:
   ```
   💎 @username, the current price of Bitcoin is $43,000 USD.
   ```

✅ **Now your bot will always mention the user in replies!** 🚀 Let me know if you need further refinements. 🔥
