- **Real-Time Data:** Fetches live stock data using [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) and cryptocurrency data using [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api).
- **Advanced Analysis:** Uses historical data to calculate technical indicators (20-day and 50-day Simple Moving Averages) and generates charts.
- **Custom Commands:** Offers commands like `!stock`, `!crypto`, `!analyze`, and restricted commands like `!secret` (if needed).
- **Market Alerts:** Sends periodic updates to a designated Discord channel.
- **Responsive Website:** A multi-page website that details services, instructions, and technical insights.

Before you begin, ensure you have installed:
- **Python 3.8+** ([Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **Git** (for version control)
- **A Text Editor or IDE** (Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
- **Docker** (optional for containerization; [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))

## 4. Discord Bot Setup

### Registering Your Bot

1. Log in to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Click **"New Application"**, name it (e.g., *FinancialBot*), and create it.
3. Under the **"Bot"** tab, click **"Add Bot"** and then copy the **Bot Token** (keep this secret).
4. Enable **Privileged Intents** (especially the Message Content Intent) in the bot settings.

### Installing Dependencies

Navigate to the `bot/` folder and install required packages:

```bash
pip install discord.py requests python-dotenv pandas matplotlib
```

Create a `requirements.txt` file with:

```
discord.py
requests
python-dotenv
pandas
matplotlib
```

### Bot Code Explanation

The `bot.py` file includes several commands:

- **`!stock SYMBOL`**: Retrieves real-time stock data.
- **`!crypto COIN`**: Retrieves current cryptocurrency data.
- **`!secret`**: A restricted command that can be enabled for specific user IDs.
- **`!analyze SYMBOL`**: Fetches historical data, calculates the 20-day and 50-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), and generates a chart using matplotlib.
- **Background Task**: Sends periodic market updates every 30 minutes to a specified Discord channel.

*(See the provided code for full details.)*

### Environment Variables (.env)

Create a `.env` file in the `bot/` folder with the following content:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_alpha_vantage_api_key_here
UPDATE_CHANNEL_ID=your_discord_channel_id_for_updates
ALLOWED_USER_IDS=123456789012345678,987654321098765432
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual values.

### Running and Testing the Bot

1. Open a terminal in the `bot/` folder.
2. Run the bot with:

   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```

3. Test the following commands in your Discord server:
   - `!stock AAPL`
   - `!crypto bitcoin`
   - `!analyze TSLA`

The bot should respond with real-time data and, for the analysis command, generate and send a chart image.

## 5. Website Setup

### HTML Pages Overview

Your website is composed of multiple pages:
- **index.html:** Home page with a hero section and overview.
- **about.html:** Background information about the project.
- **services.html:** Lists all services offered, including a section on advanced analysis.
- **analysis.html:** Detailed explanation of the advanced analysis feature.
- **contact.html:** Contact and support information.

*(See the individual HTML files for complete code.)*

### CSS Styling

The `styles.css` file provides a modern, responsive design that styles the header, navigation, hero section, content sections, cards, and footer. It includes:
- A dark sticky header with a hamburger menu on mobile.
- A hero section with a translucent overlay.
- Responsive card layouts for service descriptions.

*(See the provided CSS code for full details.)*

### JavaScript for Navigation

The `script.js` file toggles the hamburger menu for mobile navigation:

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const hamburger = document.querySelector('.hamburger');
  const navLinks = document.querySelector('.nav-links');

  hamburger.addEventListener('click', () => {
    navLinks.classList.toggle('nav-active');
  });
});
```

### Local Testing and Deployment

- **Local Testing:**  
  Open the HTML files (e.g., `index.html`) in your browser to test responsiveness and navigation.
  
- **Deployment:**  
  You can deploy the website using services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

## 6. Advanced Analysis Feature

### How It Works

The advanced analysis command (`!analyze SYMBOL`) performs the following steps:
1. **Data Retrieval:**  
   Uses the Alpha Vantage `TIME_SERIES_DAILY` endpoint to get historical stock data.
2. **Data Processing:**  
   Converts JSON data to a pandas DataFrame, sorts by date, and extracts the closing prices.
3. **Indicator Calculation:**  
   Calculates the 20-day and 50-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA).
4. **Visualization:**  
   Uses matplotlib to generate a chart displaying the closing price, 20-day SMA, and 50-day SMA.
5. **Output:**  
   The generated chart is sent as an image file to the Discord channel.

### Usage Examples

- **Example 1:**  
  **Command:** `!analyze AAPL`  
  **Outcome:** A chart for Apple Inc. displaying the closing prices and the 20-day & 50-day SMAs is generated and sent in the channel.

- **Example 2:**  
  **Command:** `!analyze TSLA`  
  **Outcome:** A similar chart for Tesla is produced, providing visual technical analysis.

## 7. Optional Docker Containerization

### For the Discord Bot

Create a `Dockerfile.bot` in the `docker/` folder:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY ../bot/requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY ../bot/bot.py .
COPY ../bot/.env .
CMD ["python", "bot.py"]
```

Build and run the bot container:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.bot -t discord-bot .
docker run -d --name my-discord-bot discord-bot
```

### For the Website

Create a `Dockerfile.web` in the `docker/` folder:

```dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
RUN rm -rf /usr/share/nginx/html/*
COPY ../website/ /usr/share/nginx/html/
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

Build and run the website container:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.web -t static-web .
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name my-static-web static-web
```

Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view your site.
